<p><a href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a> makes telephony dead simple for developers.  A developer should be able to do cool things with their API, like sending text messages and setting up conference calls in under 5 minutes.  Such a company must live or die on API design.</p>

<p>I was very fortunate to speak with <a href="https://twitter.com/jf">Joel Franusic</a> to learn how Twilio engages and understands developers when building their API. The following is a based on our conversation:</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Grab your Audience's Attention.</h2>

<p>If you do not blog about your research, you might as well take all your papers and burn them right now.
<strong>Because no one will read your paper or remember your talk at a conference.</strong></p>

<p>Not because it isn't wonderful work, but because human bandwidth is terribly limited. Most new memories will fade after a few hours or days, 
and essentially non-existent after 3 months. In an event as fully packed as a conference, with thousands of people, hundreds of conversations, and dozens of 
presentations, chances are your presentation will be forgotten against all the other competing memories.</p>

<p>People's time and attention costs money.  To get your research presented in 20 minutes to room of 100 people, 
costs each person easily $2000 (registeration, airfare, and hotel) to be there.  <strong>Collectively, was your talk well-worth $200,000?</strong></p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Prepare Takeaways</h2>

<p>Blogging about your research can spread your message to a much bigger room of people.<br>
But these people do not have 20 minutes, and your writing must reflect that. 
Further, consider how people consume content: You are competing with several other open tabs from facebook, twitter, etc.</p>

<ul>
<li>Most readers will only spend about 10-30 seconds reading your blog post.</li>
<li>Stick to only one topic; anything else will derail your message.</li>
<li>Prepacked takeaway points can be read quickly and spread through social media, reinforcing your message.</li>
